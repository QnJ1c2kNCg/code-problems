# Advent of Code 2025

This year, I decided to use Lua. I had zero experience with Lua before this, but it was a lot of _fun_ to use. Indeed, if I had to describe Lua in one word, it would _fun_. (It does get a tad annoying when you need time and space efficiency though).

Also, this is my first year finishing AoC! (mainly because there are only 12 days and I am jobless!)
